# Anycubic-mega-S-dual-color-2-into-1

Butchered code for the Anycubic Mega series printers i.e. Mega S maybe others running klipper and with BL touch and 2 into 1 hot end with stock board, some lines are most liklely not necessary or are redundant. Configuring of slicer is a must. Use at your risk, it worked for me, but maybe not for your setup, some things WILL need to be changed in your Klipper config file.
